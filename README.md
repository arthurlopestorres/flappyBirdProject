# flappyBirdProject
This is a training project that I developed while attending programming classes.

Languages used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

The main difficulty I faced in this project was dealing with positioning of the elements (specially when identifying if the bird hit the barriers or not).
In genereal, it was challenging but really good to practice callbacks, constructor functions, creating and manipulating states and more. 
I know some of these things won't be used very often due to the needs of projects in general, but the challenge kept me going until the project was finished. =)
